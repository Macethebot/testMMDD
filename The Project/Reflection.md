As much of this workshop is centered on introducing ‘personal’ digital archiving, the ‘personal’ is where the workshop starts.

This can be a group call and response where you put the responses on a board. These reflection activities can be done solo, in pairs, or as a small group (4 or fewer). Students shouldn’t share anything too personal or detailed to protect their privacy and maintain certain boundaries in the classroom. Over sharing risks overexposing students in the classroom setting, which can impact their comfort with the activity or even classroom participation long term. While this workshop won’t be storing any student data in school or district-wide databases, student privacy is a major concern. This [primer](https://studentprivacycompass.org/resource/student-privacy-primer/) from The Student Privacy Compass details what student data is, who wants to use it, and how we can protect it.

Below are two options for activities that encourage students to conduct an audit of their digital materials. Guide students through the prompts and have them take some notes. The findings that occur here can be helpful throughout the workshop.

The first activity focuses on having students reflect on their digital material creation: making, storing/saving, and retrieval.

The second activity is similar, but needs the use of external files to have students reflect.

## Digital Audits

### Activity A:

#### **Making**

What types of digital materials do you make?

- Ex: class assignments, personal projects or content creation materials
- Ex: photos, videos, text documents, audio tracks, etc

#### **Storing**

Of the materials mentioned, how are you storing these items?

- Online storage system?
- Print things out and store them physically?
- Everything in one folder on a personal device?
- Let the device choose for you?

#### **Saving**

When returning to a particular folder or storage location, how are you deciding what to intentionally save?

- Do you save an item if you find that you keep looking in downloads to open it?
- Does the item need to be for a class or project?
- Is it an item you know you will need to turn in to an organization for a job or government application?
- Is it something you know you want to share online or send to a friend or family member?

#### **Retrieval**

Does your making, storing, retrieving process work?

- Are there times when you can’t find something?
- Do you end up turning in a late submission because something was unretrievable?
- Do you find that the proper version isn’t what you saved?

### Activity B:

Our digital devices are a reflection of us; that’s why algorithms are so great at serving up things we want to consume or engage with.

Share some images of a desktop, the inside of a folder. Memes and GIFs of infinite scroll of pictures, looking through folders.

Based on the media shared, what patterns and observations emerge? Some questions to get the conversation going:

- What are some things that stand out about the digital content of this fictional person?
- What words would we use to describe what we see?
    - cluttered, organized, intentional, frantic

Turn the observation inward. Looking at their own devices, computers and iPads, what observations could be made?

- What type of moments are being captured in your files?
- Is it primarily school, professional, or personal creations? A mix?
- What assumptions might someone make about your lifestyle based on how you organize your folders, files, and applications?
- Do you feel you rediscover things you forgot you saved or that you haven’t used in a while?

After either activity

Turn the conversation over to the question of saving and remembering.

Digital materials are saved, and often that is for a functional purpose; to return to as a school or work assignment or as an ongoing personal project, but these materials also function as memory (not the literal computer space allocation).

What you save and what you don’t save are a reflection of the person you exist as in a particular time and over time. A great way to illustrate this point is to ask if anyone has found an old diary, or opened an old text document with writing from years past.

In the same way we have access to letters and photographs as primary source documents, the files you create today are a digital memory of the time you live in today.

### Possible Tie In Examples

Archives of physical ephemera digitized, marginalia, digital archives

_**If there is relevant multimedia from the class subject, having examples here is also good_

Digital Archives

[Colored Conventions](https://coloredconventions.org/)

Everyday people saving their creations intentionally or not are the foundation of our history and art.

## Power Tie In

When thinking about what we save and remember in accessible institutions like archives and museums, whose memory is preserved, and who is lost or erased from the collective memory?

In thinking about our digital management and saving, can our practices affect who gets saved and remembered digitally in the future? Are there ways people are already doing this?

## Transition

In thinking about your digital materials, what are some challenges that jeopardize your saving and memory?

Are the methods you currently use secure?

- If the company that has the service you save your files on goes bankrupt or has a server shortage, what happens to your stuff
- If your device is stolen or gets an incurable virus, what happens to your stuff
