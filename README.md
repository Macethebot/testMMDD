This self-guided workshop helps you reflect and develop better strategies for managing your personal digital materials.

It's especially for students and educators interested in critical approaches to meaning making, digital organization, and preservation.

The core components of this workshop are:

- **Reflection** – Critical reflection of digital habits and systems
- **Digital Ecosystems** –  
- **Personal Preservation** – Learn practical methods to build your own management and preservation system
- **Sustainable Habits** – Create goals for integrating maintenance into sustained practice

This project encourages you to think critically about your "digital self"—exploring digital memory, agency, and what it means to maintain your personal data in an increasingly complex technological landscape.

By the end, participants will have more appreciation for [*their digital creations?*] and a more strategic plan for organizing their digital life.
