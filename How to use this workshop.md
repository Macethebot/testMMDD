The core function of this workshop is introducing personal digital archiving in a learning setting as a tool for expanding practices of digital maintenance and critical reflection. Some use cases for incorporating the workshop are:

- Implementing a start of the school year or semester digital management system, assignments and projects

- Personal tie-in to lessons on examining historical and cultural artifacts in an arts or humanities subject

- Reflection and production of community knowledge production and archival

However you plan to implement it, the workshop allows students to reflect on their digital materials, analyze the systems those materials exist in, build their own management or archive practices, and some sustainable frameworks and habits for their new skills.

## Who is this workshop for?

The primary audience is educators of students in secondary or early post-secondary learning environments. If you are already teaching digital literacy and critical thinking skills, this workshop can offer a full or partial addition to a lesson or skill day. MMDD is not exhaustive as the realities of teaching mean there is limited time, but there are extra resources further down this page to either extend the lesson or streamline how to incorporate this workshop into a curriculum.

## Structure of Workshop

The four parts of the workshop are:

1. Reflection - Critical reflection of digital habits and systems

2. Deconstructing a Digital Ecosystem - An interrogation of our digital ecosystems for managing our digital files and data at large

3. Building Your System - Learn practical methods to build your own management and preservation system

4. Sustainable Habits - Create goals for integrating maintenance into sustained practice

Each section also includes a short introduction that frames the activity and an ending that either closes the module or transitions to the next one.

## Material Needs and Time Estimates

This workshop requires internet-enabled devices or devices that are used for file storage, i.e. laptops or desktops.

- Personal devices are good as students would have the most familiarity with their own, but shared institutional devices are also fine

The whole workshop is approximately 60 minutes, with each section taking 10/15.

## Before You Begin

- Review each section to understand the flow

- Test technical elements that will be used for demonstration

- Gather relevant examples and materials for your intended framing

Other considerations:

It could be helpful to have students compile a short written assignment about digital file management, archiving, or digital memory to gauge preliminary thoughts and assumptions. That way you have a litmus of how brand new the concepts will be to students. 

The workshop will touch on power dynamics and surveillance in technology. Please make sure that you are comfortable engaging and that you can navigate uncomfortable truths from students should they arise.
